MAGIC Gamma Telescope ML Project
üåå Project Overview

This project explores the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset, a real-world dataset from high-energy astrophysics.
The goal is to classify gamma-ray events vs. background hadron events using machine learning techniques.

This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Training and evaluating multiple ML models

Comparing performance using key metrics

Visualizing results (confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves)

Interpreting results in the context of astrophysics
